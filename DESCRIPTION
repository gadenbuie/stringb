Description: Base R already ships with string handling capabilities
    'out-of-the-box' but lacks streamlined function names and workflow.
    The stringi (stringr) package on the other hand has well named functions
    and allows for a streamlined workflow but adds further dependencies and
    regular expression interpretation between base R functions and stringi
    functions might differ. This packages aims at closing the gap by providing
    another string handling package solely based wrapping bese R functions into
    stringr/stringi function names and workflow. Fruthermore, stringb adds
    some further convenience functions for sring handling.
