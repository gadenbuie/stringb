Description: Base R already ships with string handling capabilities
    'out-of-the-box' but lacks streamlined function names and workflow.
    The stringi (stringr) package on the other hand has well named functions,
    extensive Unicode support and allows for a streamlined workflow. On the
    other hand it adds dependencies and regular expression interpretation
    between base R functions and stringi functions might differ.
    This packages aims at providing a solution to the use case of unwanted
    dependencies on the one hand but wanted streamlined text processing on the
    other. The packages functions are solely based on wrapping base R functions
    into 'stringr'/'stringi' function names. Along the way it adds one or two
    extra functions and last but not least provides all functions as generics
    and defaults therefore allowing for adding methods for other text structures
    besides plain character.
